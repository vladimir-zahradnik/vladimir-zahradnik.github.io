# zahradnik.io
In this repository, I host the code for my personal blog.

The website is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) with the [Novela](https://github.com/zahradnik-io/gatsby-theme-novela) template from [Narative](https://www.narative.co). As they recently discontinued this theme, I maintain my own fork.
