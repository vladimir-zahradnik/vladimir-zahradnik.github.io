*Goodbye letters have a long tradition in companies. Usually on the last day of employment, you write a brief email thanking your colleagues for a pleasant time at the company and leaving your contact details in case a former colleague wants to get in touch with you. People often send such a letter to the whole company.*

*When I was leaving GlobalLogic in December 2018, I also wanted to write a goodbye letter. But sending it to the whole company, even to people I barely knew, felt too impersonal. I did it differently. I wrote a letter in which I also alluded to things that only my team would understand. It was so much more personal and I hoped to make them laugh too. In sending this letter, I chose specific people, individuals. I added each one separately. That way I knew exactly that only those I cared about would read it.*

*The letter was very well received. It surprised everyone positively and people talked about it for several days. My farewell was therefore as good as I imagined it would be.*

*I attach it below literally as it was written. I know you won't understand everything, because you weren't there with me at that time, but at least you'll have an idea of how I said goodbye.*

TL; DR; My contact information is below.

Hey, guys,
As many of you already know, today is my last day at GlobalLogic, I'm quitting after almost three years. At the same time, today is also interesting because it is the winter solstice and there is real snow outside.

I'm glad that I stayed longer, despite the original plan to depart on 7.12. I experienced a driving episode of Jan Hricko that I'm sure you'll remind him for many years to come, much like you'll always bring up my run on the mountain bike trail. Let me add to this episode that I was sober and would do it again :)

After almost eight years as an employee, I decided to try the other side of the coin; whichever way it turns out. But I will do everything I can to succeed as I always have. I already made my plans for the first months, and I have several visions for the longer term. I'll see what path I end up taking. And if it still doesn't work out, I'll take it as my longest summer break ever.

I will work mainly in Prešov, but I won't withdraw out of Košice completely. I have too many activities here for that. You will probably meet me at meetups organized by Dan Kuchta, also at EastcodeSessions and anywhere else where there will be an interesting guest. Last but not least, you'll be able to meet me at my speaking club. As my impromptu talk on Tuesday showed, I still have room for improvement...

GlobalLogic and especially Kestra were for me mainly about the team. Although it may not seem like it, I will miss the atmosphere of our lab. As long as you miss me, you'll be able to have lunch with me from time to time. Jano Haláček will be happy to talk to you when it is relevant. I'm also happy to come to teambuilding events if Karči invites me. You won't be able to get me drunk, but you can try. And who knows, maybe I'll meet you in the lab when some good samaritan lets me in.

If you've made it this far, I wish you a pleasant and peaceful holiday season and little overtime. Take care!

Cheers,<br />
Vlado
