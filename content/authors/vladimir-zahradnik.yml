name: Vladimír Záhradník
bio: |
  Hi, I'm Vladimír Záhradník — an IT guy, blogger, entrepreneur, a creative soul
  from the bottom of my heart, and a music lover.

  I share the Architect personality type (INTJ-A), which means I'm a confident
  individualist. That is the reason why I fight so passionately for the freedom
  of speech, and I'm very sensitive when my rights and liberties are opressed.
  And one more thing: I'm brutally honest and I say freely what's on my mind.

  I believe in sharing information. This passion drives my regular contributions
  to open-source, writing blogs, and shooting videos. If we help each other,
  we can build a better place for everyone. Join me on my journey!
